### Chart.JS

**Chart.js** is a community maintained free open-source JavaScript library for data visualization, which supports 8 different chart types by using the HTML ```<canvas>``` element.

**ng2-charts**  is an open-source JavaScript Library that provides baseChart directives which can be applied to an HTML canvas element and is built exclusively for Angular2+. 

Chart.JS is responsive, and allows for mixed chart types (ex. a line chart with a bar graph on top of it), as well as different axis types (date time, logarithmic, and even custom scales), and even supports animations.
