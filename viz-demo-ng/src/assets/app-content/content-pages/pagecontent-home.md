# Angular Visualization Demos

This site is an [Open Water Foundation](https://openwaterfoundation.org/) Angular application that demonstrates visualizations for time series and other data. Specific examples use popular and feature-rich libraries such as ChartJS and Plotly. Examples focus on water-related data. The demonstrations are used to prototype and troubleshoot features that are integrated into other Angular applications.

See the Open Water Foundation [owf-app-viz-demo-ng](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-viz-demo-ng) repository for more information.
